### Beer Recommendation System

This project will use data from the [Brewery DB API](http://www.brewerydb.com/developers) to make a content-based recommendation system.

Initial plans are to combine both beer attributes such as ABV, IBUs, and brewery with a beer description similarity score (using TF-IDF and cosine similarity) to arrive at appropriate recommendations.
